# The-Old-Mans-Haunted-House




    Your in a haunted house looking for your lost dog.
    
    Its like a maze in here.
    
    Every room you go into leads to another room.
        
        some of the rooms lead backwards or send 
        you into a wormhole (loop) or down a shaft or
        into the walls up rope ladders. 
        
        there are ghosts, and goblins in the rooms.
        
        there are also clues in some rooms (dog fur, collar)
            
    there is a backpack that you can put things in.
        (key to the attic from roof door, 
         iron fireplace poker for killing ghosts,
         holy water for gouls)
        
    there is a final boss - and ultimate escape.
